# Social-Media-App :computer:

My social media concept will allow people to rate eachother’s posts and profiles using a scoring system similar to popular review sites such as TripAdvisor. User’s will be allowed to post text, images and videos onto the social media feed (like many mainstream platforms), however other users will then be able to rate the post on a scale of 1-5 stars, giving that post its own score.

User’s will not be able to see the post’s score until after they vote, to avoid any outside persuasion, and will also not be allowed to change their vote. Over time the post will accumulate votes from various user’s and end up having an average score (amount of reviews per post will be visible to give context to the score). As well as this, people will be able to vote on people’s profiles (only one vote per account). The user’s personal score will also be shown when they post.

:grey_exclamation: Disclaimer: This concept is not meant to be taken too seriously as I believe the actual public rating of people could lead to a toxic environment that people would not want to be a part of.
