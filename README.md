# ⭐ Mate Rate 

Mate Rate is a satirical take on standard social media, with a focus on seeking other people’s approval via the content they post. The core feature of my app is the five-star rating system that is present when engaging with other posts. Users can score other people’s post once, on a scale of 1-5. Each rating on a post will have a direct impact on the post author’s profile score. This means if lots of people rate a user’s post highly, that person will have a higher profile score, and therefore be more “popular” than other people.

:grey_exclamation: Disclaimer: This concept is not meant to be taken too seriously as I believe the actual public rating of people could lead to a toxic environment that people would not want to be a part of.
